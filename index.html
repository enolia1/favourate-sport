My Favorite Sport (or Game) Tennis
People have always said that sports are so great for anyone who struggle with drama-filled lives, anxiety, depression, and many more problems like this. They say this because sports occupy a portion of our time and provide us with an escape we can‚Äôt find anywhere else. When we are playing a sport, we are so focused on what we need to do in the heat of competition that nothing else in the world seems important.

Tennis is a very interesting sport, and it is my favorite sport. This is because playing tennis is really cool, and it needs many high-toned skills. Most of all, it only requires two persons to play. Playing tennis is really elegant. The angle of serving balls is high-toned art. Playing tennis is not as easy as playing badminton. The angle control is a very important skill in playing tennis. Any attenuate change will affect the trail of the ball.

Tennis is a sport played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a strung racquet to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into the opponent‚Äôs court. The modern game of tennis was born in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century. Then it was called ‚Äúlawn tennis‚Äù. Tennis soon became popular among the upper- class English-speaking population.

Then it began to be played around the world. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including people in wheelchairs.

Other than the fact that the tiebreaker was adopted in the 1970s, the rules of tennis have not changed much since the 1890s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of ‚Äúinstant replay‚Äù technology coupled with a point challenge system. This allows a player to challenge the official call of a point.

Tennis is a major spectator sport, especially the four Grand Slam tournaments: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. These tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world. They are held annually.

Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). These events possess historical significance and also carry huge prize funds. Grand Slam men‚Äôs tournaments have best-of-five-set matches throughout.

At present, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments. The exception is Wimbledon, (where the grass surface doesn‚Äôt allow this) and junior tennis competitions.

Grand Slam tournaments are often seen as the culmination of a particular season, such as the US Open Series. Wimbledon players are required to wear predominantly white. This rule has made certain players like Andre Agassi avoid the tournament.

Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, and Pete Sampras are among the greatest tennis players in the history of the sport. Among the contemporaries, Roger Federer is considered to have the potential to surpass the achievements of these illustrious predecessors. Many even feel that Federer could become the greatest player in the history of the game.

Tennis is a popular sport. It‚Äôs not like volleyball or baseball which needs to scratch a team. When I wanted to play it, I just needed to find one person to play with me. It‚Äôs a very convenient sport. I could play it only with my uncle/aunty who used to play tennis when he/she was a teenager. It is the last reason why tennis became my favorite sport. In sum, tennis is not only easy to play but also an elegant sport that requires skills. It‚Äôs the best way for me to relax. If I had time I would practice it constantly!

          Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
          single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
          (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord
          to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net
          and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre
          the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
          return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not
          gain a point, while the opposite player will.[1][2] Tennis is an
          Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages.
          The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including
          wheelchair users. The original forms of tennis developed in France
          during the late Middle Ages.[3] The modern form of tennis originated
          in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[4] It
          had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as
          croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called
          real tennis.[5] The rules of modern tennis have changed little since
          the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep
          one foot on the ground at all times,[6][7] and the adoption of the
          tiebreak in the 1970s.[8] A recent addition to professional tennis has
          been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a
          point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call
          of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.[9][10] Tennis is played by
          millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator
          sport.[11] The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the
          majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open, played on
          hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay courts; Wimbledon,
          played on grass courts; and the US Open, also played on
          hardcourts.[12]..
